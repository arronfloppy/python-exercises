""" The set cover is a NP-complete problem
From wikipedia:
Given a set of elements {1, 2, â€¦, n} (called the universe) and a collection S of m sets whose union equals the universe,
 the set cover problem is to identify the smallest sub-collection of S whose union equals the universe.
  For example, consider the universe U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the collection of sets S = { {1, 2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {4, 5} }. 
  Clearly the union of S is U. However, we can cover all of the elements with the following, smaller number of sets: { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5} }.
